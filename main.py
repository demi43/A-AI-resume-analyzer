**TASK:**
Provide a comprehensive, constructive, and actionable critique of the user's resume.
Analyze the resume against the provided job context.

**INPUTS:**
1.  **RESUME_TEXT:**
    ```
    {resume_text}
    ```
2.  **JOB_CONTEXT:** The resume should be evaluated for a candidate applying for: **{job_context}**

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
Present your feedback in Markdown format, following this exact structure:

---

### **Overall Score: [Provide a score out of 100]**

*   **Clarity & Readability:** [Score / 25]
*   **Impact & Achievements:** [Score / 35]
*   **Relevance to Job:** [Score / 25]
*   **Formatting & ATS Friendliness:** [Score / 15]

### **Executive Summary**
(A 2-3 sentence high-level overview. Start with the strongest aspect of the resume and then state the single most important area for improvement.)

---

### **Section-by-Section Analysis**

**1. General Formatting & Readability**
*   **‚úÖ What's Good:** (Comment on clean layout, good use of white space, clear fonts, etc.)
*   **üîç Areas for Improvement:** (Comment on inconsistent formatting, dense text blocks, unprofessional fonts, length, or typos/grammar.)
*   **üí° Actionable Suggestion:** (Provide a specific, actionable tip.)

**2. Professional Summary / Objective**
*   **‚úÖ What's Good:** (Comment on its impact and clarity.)
*   **üîç Areas for Improvement:** (Analyze if it's generic, passive, or not tailored to the **JOB_CONTEXT**.)
*   **üí° Actionable Suggestion:** (Provide a rewritten example tailored to the job context.)

**3. Skills Section**
*   **‚úÖ What's Good:** (Comment on relevant skills and good organization.)
*   **üîç Areas for Improvement:** (Are the skills relevant? Are they just buzzwords? Are they backed up by experience?)
*   **üí° Actionable Suggestion:** (Suggest grouping skills or adding specific keywords from the job context.)

**4. Professional Experience**
*   **‚úÖ What's Good:** (Praise the use of strong action verbs or quantified results.)
*   **üîç Areas for Improvement:** (Identify bullet points that describe duties instead of achievements. Point out where metrics are missing.)
*   **üí° Actionable Suggestion (Rewrite Example):** Show how to transform a weak bullet point into an impactful one using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). For example, turn "Responsible for social media" into "Grew organic social media engagement by 45% over 6 months by executing a new content strategy."

**5. Projects Section**
*   **‚úÖ What's Good:** (Comment on relevant project choices.)
*   **üîç Areas for Improvement:** (Do descriptions state the problem, tech stack, and outcome? Are there links to GitHub/live demos?)
*   **üí° Actionable Suggestion:** (Suggest adding quantifiable outcomes or a link to the repository.)

---

### **Keyword & Skill Alignment for: {job_context}**

*   **Keywords Present:** (List key skills/technologies from the job context that you found in the resume.)
*   **Keywords Missing:** (List important skills/technologies from the job context that are missing and suggest where they could be added.)
*   **Overall Recommendation:** (A final sentence on how well the resume is tailored.)
